        <div itemprop="recipeInstructions" class="directions text">
            <p class="line"><strong>Choose your tri tip:</strong></p><p class="line">If you can, get your tri tip from a local butcher. They will have what is called &quot;prime&quot; cuts, which has more fat and marbling than you can find at the grocery store. It will take longer to cook because of all the fat. (Fat=flavor)</p><p class="line">If you buy your tri tip at the grocery store, make sure that you go to a high-end grocery store. High-end grocery stores are going to have mid-range cuts of meat. A discount store is going to have discount meat, and it will not be marbled well. Your roast will shrink a lot more and it will take a shorter time to cook.</p><p class="line">Ask the butcher or grocery clerk for a well marbled tri tip roast, or &quot;California cut&quot; or a &quot;triangle roast.&quot; If they still don&apos;t know what you mean, ask for the bottom sirloin butt (subprimal cut).</p><p class="line"><strong>Prepare the marinade:</strong></p><p class="line">In a small bowl, combine all the spices: galic salt, seasoning salt, kosher salt, pepper, sugar, garlic powder, and parsley. 1 tablespoons of dried parsley is fine, you can use 2-3 tablespoons if you are using fresh parsley.</p><p class="line">If you are grilling, trim the fat cap from the roast. If you are oven roasting, leave it on.</p><p class="line">Rub the spice mixture all over the roast with your hands. Place in a large ziplock bag and add 1/4 cup olive oil. Seal the bag and massage the oil into the meat. Place in the fridge and marinate, turning a couple times, for about 8 hours. (This is ideal. If you only have an hour or even 15 minutes, guess what, you&apos;re still going to get a great roast. But the longer you marinate, the more flavor there will be. You can leave it in the fridge for up to 3 days.)</p><p class="line"><strong>How to Grill Tri Tip:</strong></p><p class="line">Remove the meat from the fridge 30 minutes before you plan to cook it. It should start cooking at room temperature.</p><p class="line">Preheat your grill to high heat. Make sure you give it a good 15-20 minutes to heat up.</p><p class="line">Place the roast on a plate and discard the marinade (or save it to add to a pan sauce if you plan to make one).</p><p class="line">Grease the grill (or brush oil directly on the meat).</p><p class="line">Sear the roast over high heat for about 2-3 minutes, until it is nicely browned. Flip over (grease again if necessary) and sear the other side for 2-3 minutes. Keep the lid shut as much as you can.</p><p class="line">Turn off the heat on the side of the grill that your meat is on. We are cooking it over INDIRECT heat. Lower the other side of the grill to low heat. If you are cooking over charcoals, arrange the meat and charcoals so that the meat is off to the side, not cooking directly above the charcoal.</p><p class="line">Grill without opening the lid for about 20-25 minutes, or about 10-15 minutes per pound, depending on how rare you want it. Rare is 135 degrees F. Medium rare is 145 degrees F. Use a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the roast to check the temperature.</p><p class="line">Remove the roast from the grill, and place on a rimmed serving platter. Cover well with foil and let rest for 10-15 minutes.</p><p class="line">Slice against the grain and serve (see photos). Try this tri tip with it&apos;s traditional side dish, Santa Maria Pinquito Beans!</p><p class="line"><strong>How to Roast Tri Tip in the Oven:</strong></p><p class="line">Remove the meat from the fridge 30 minutes before you plan to cook it. It should start cooking at room temperature.</p><p class="line">Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.</p><p class="line">Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place an oven-safe cooling rack on top, and set aside.</p><p class="line">Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil. When the oil shimmers, place the roast in the pan, fat side down. Sear the roast for about 3-4 minutes, until a brown crust has developed. Flip and sear the other side.</p><p class="line">Place the roast on the cooling rack. Save the marinade and oil from searing for a pan sauce, if you choose to make one.</p><p class="line">Put the roast in the oven and bake at 400 degrees for about 20-30 minutes, or about 10-15 minutes per pound, depending on how rare you want it. Rare is 130-135 degrees F. Medium rare is 135-145 degrees F. Don&apos;t cook it past 145; the meat doesn&apos;t have enough fat for medium well or well. Use a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the roast to check the temperature.</p><p class="line">Remove the roast from the oven, and cover well with foil. Let rest for 10-15 minutes.</p><p class="line">Slice against the grain and serve (see photos). Try this tri tip with it&apos;s traditional side dish, Santa Maria Pinquito Beans!</p><p class="line"><strong>To make a pan sauce:</strong></p><p class="line">Save all meat drippings<em> and excess marinade. Add to a small saucepan with 2 cups beef broth.</em> Bring to a boil. In a small bowl, combine 1/3 cup cold water and 3 tablespoons flour. Whisk until smooth, and then slowly pour into the boiling broth. Continue simmering for 5-10 minutes until thickened. Add 2 tablespoons butter, season with salt and pepper, and serve with meat.</p>
